# Power-BI-Sales-Dashboard
Welcome to the analysis of Superstore sales dataset. In this project we will try to understand the sales pattern and what drives most of the sales and also forecast sales of 15 days. Created an interactive dashboard to gain valuable insights.
# Insights

* In sales by payment mode we can see that people prefer cash on delivery and by providing some offers in cards we can generate some more sales as it will be seamless for a lot of consumers.
* In sales by month there is a increase in our sales between october to december.
* AS well as in sales by profit also we can see that there is a high steep in winter season. 
* This will help us to lookout for more ways to drive sales in winter season.
